wordpress-to-markdown
=====================

Uses the exported XML file from WordPress, and creates a folder/file structure that contains all of the blog posts, converted to markdown format.

This is highly experimental at best. It was developed for my own use to do a one time conversion from WordPress to markdown for a static generator such as [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad).
